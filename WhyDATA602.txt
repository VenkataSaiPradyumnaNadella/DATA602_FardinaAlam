I am fascinated by the power of data and it can help in drawing meaningful insight. I understood that data science is a combination of statistics and machine learning algorithms to make predictions and solve real-world problems. Through DATA602, I want to strengthen my understanding of the complete data science lifecycle starting with data collection to policy prediction. 
In this course, I look forward to 
Develop a foundational understanding of data science, encompassing key concepts, methodologies, and tools.
Proficiently use Python for data science applications, including data types, collection, and manipulation using libraries like Pandas.
Explore machine learning concepts, including classifications, decision trees, regression, and feature engineering.
Evaluate machine learning models using appropriate metrics, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of model performance.
Understand advanced topics such as neural networks.
Understand the importance of applying ethical frameworks and guidelines to make informed decisions in real-world data scenarios.

This course will help me build a strong foundation, and develop the skills needed to responsibly and effectively apply data science in various domains.
